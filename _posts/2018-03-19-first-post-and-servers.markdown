Well this is the first one huh? The main reason I wanted to start this blog is that I could never find someone's blog that chronicled how they went from not working in tech to breaking into the industry and their subsequent growth. At most what I would find would be a single article about learning Rails in like 3 months and then somehow ending up working as a developer for Snap

I have to admit I already work in tech, but I started it all being self taught. I have always been a computer nerd, and never realized that I could make a living off it.

The other reason I started this blog was to learn how to deploy a simple app to AWS. I currently use GitHub Pages, Heroku, and Surge.sh to host all my content, but I really wanted to learn how to basically do more enterprise and nitty gritty type hosting

That's actually why I used Jekyll as the framework to build this blog since it's pretty simple and I don't want to spend a couple hours setting up a Rails app to do this.  

Here are the steps I took to get this blog on AWS:
I will also include links at the end of the post with the tutorials and 
information that I found particularly useful

#### 1. Get a domain
Seriously get one they aren't that expensive and you can do a whole lot with one. I just got a .tech domain they are pretty cheap and if you are a student with a student email you can get one for free for one year. 

One thing I highly recommend is learning about how DNS actually works since it's one of the most important parts of the internet, and seriously it's not that complicated just sit down with it and try to mentally figure it out once you do you'll have what an old professor of mine called a Walden Pond Experience

#### 2. Get AWS free tier
This is pretty self explanatory most places you have to pay as you grow. AWS offers a free tier that for my purposes is enough and it's free for a year so that is nice.

#### 3. Deploy to AWS
I used the tutorial in one of the links provided along with some other stuff. I haven't actually gotten it there soooo...
